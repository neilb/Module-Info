0.39 2024-08-28 NEILB
    - Fixed RT#129677 with patch from HAARG++.

0.38 2024-08-28 NEILB
    - Get rid of ' as package namespace separator

0.37 2015-11-01 NEILB
    - Added a has_pod() method, which returns the path to the file
      containing the pod (it could be a .pod file), if there is one.
      Thanks to YANICK for this.
    - Listed NEILB as the current maintainer in the AUTHOR section.
      Thanks again to YANICK.
    - Added link to github repo to doc.

0.36 2015-10-23 NEILB
    - Dropped our own fork of B::Utils, now rely on CPAN one - RT#13524
    - Now works on recent versions of Perl - RT#97105
    - Pod tests not run on installation - RT#90599

0.35_07 2015-10-19 NEILB
    - I had missed another instance of "the Windows cwd() issue" affecting
      t/n1_modules_required.t

0.35_06 2015-10-17 NEILB
    - Added "use strict" to both modules
    - Made the pod coverage test a release test RT#90599
    - Added MIN_PERL_VERSION to Makefile.PL
    - Added a basic README

0.35_05 2015-10-16 NEILB
    - Had a single failure reported by CPAN Testers for Perl 5.22/Windows.
      On Windows, if you "use Cwd" and then call cwd(), then it does an
      implicit "use Win32". On recent perls (sometime after 5.20.1) this
      seems to get built into the op tree in a way that looks like the
      scope doing the cwd() use'd Win32. There are several magic functions
      in Cwd.pm which will probably trigger this behaviour. I'll see how this
      change tests out, and possibly just document it for a non dev release.

0.35_04 2015-10-14 NEILB
    - Sigh, forgot to update the min version of B::Utils in Makefile.PL
      Thanks to SREZIC for letting me know.

0.35_03 2015-10-13 NEILB
    - Removed File::Spec from t/lib/
    - Set min required version of B::Utils to 0.27, as that release fixes
      the remaining failing tests.
    - Hacked const_sv() to cope with the change in OP_METHOD_NAMED
      that happened at 5.21.5 (or possibly an earlier 5.21.*).

0.35_02 2015-06-15 NEILB
    - Sigh, forgot to add B::Utils to PREREQ_PM

0.35_01 2015-06-15 NEILB
    - Dropped B::BUtils in favour of using the standard B::Utils.
      subroutines_called() stopped working correctly for standard function
      calls, identifying them as calls via symbolic references. Fixed that.
    - Dropped Build.PL

0.35 2013-09-08 14:10:31 CEST
    - Handle 'package NAME VERSION' syntax (patch by Norbert Gruener)
    - Added repository and license info to metadata
    - Tweaked format of Changes (this file) to match CPAN::Changes::Spec

0.34 2013-05-21 21:48:49 CEST
    - Replace Test::Soundex in tests with Class::Struct, since
      Text::Soundex will not be in core in Perl 5.19 and up.
    - Replace ExtUtils::MY_Metafile with META_MERGE in Makefile.PL.

0.33 2013-02-9 13:12:22 CET

      upgraded (patch by Andreas Koenig).

    - Added -h option to module_info.

0.30 2005-12-20 20:17:09 CET
    - Renamed the forked B::Utils to B::BUtils to avoid clashes
      until it is merged into the mainline.

0.29 2005-11-22 21:28:26 CET
    - Fixed version() for complex expressions.
    - Corrected some POD errors in module_info.

0.28_50 2005-07-10 21:48:19 CEST
    - Added support for version.pm (based upon a
      patch by John Peacock).
    - Fixed the safe() attribute to be per-object instead
      of global.

0.28 2005-04-17 17:10:33 CET
    - Correct the attributions of the fixes in 0.27 (I swapped
      authors' names).
    - Added Module::Build support as an alternative to
      ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
    - Added safe() option to forbid unsafe operations (currently
      executes version() code in a Safe compartment and forbids most
      other operations).
    - Fixed compatibility down to Perl 5.004_04.

0.27 2005-03-4 07:56:58 CET
    - Added missing localization of $_ in version().
      (thanks to Johan Lodin)
    - Fixed new_from_loaded() to return nothing when the module
      is in fact not loaded. (thanks to Boris Zentner)

0.25 2004-07-11 16:36:11 CEST

0.05 2001-11-23 18:06:22 EST
